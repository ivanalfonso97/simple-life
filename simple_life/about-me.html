                        I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't 
                        even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                        and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                        I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a 
                        smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't 
                        know what else to do. And it worked.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-title">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, 
                        enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        With how much it turned my life around,
